## Introduction
Are you looking to add a touch of elegance to your images? With Aspose.Drawing for .NET, you can easily create captivating photo frames to enhance the visual appeal of your pictures. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of creating stunning photo frames using Aspose.Drawing's powerful features.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Drawing for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Drawing library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/drawing/net/).
- Image File: Prepare an image file that you want to frame. For this tutorial, we'll use a sample image named "cat.jpg."
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Drawing functionalities. Add the following lines at the beginning of your code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing.Text;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Load the Image
```csharp
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UseCases", "cat.jpg")))
{
    // Your code for Step 1 goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Create Graphics Object
```csharp
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UseCases", "cat.jpg")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);
    // Your code for Step 2 goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Set Graphics Properties
```csharp
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UseCases", "cat.jpg")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);
    graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;
    graphics.PageUnit = GraphicsUnit.Pixel;
    // Your code for Step 3 goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Draw Rectangles
```csharp
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UseCases", "cat.jpg")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);
    graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;
    graphics.PageUnit = GraphicsUnit.Pixel;
    var pen = new Pen(Color.Magenta, 1);
    int gap = 2;
    // Draw outer rectangle
    graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, 0, 0, image.Width - 1, image.Height - 1);
    // Draw inner rectangle
    graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, gap, gap, image.Width - gap - 1, image.Height - gap - 1);
    // Your code for Step 4 goes here
}
```
## Step 5: Save the Framed Image
```csharp
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UseCases", "cat.jpg")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);
    graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;
    graphics.PageUnit = GraphicsUnit.Pixel;
    var pen = new Pen(Color.Magenta, 1);
    int gap = 2;
    // Draw outer rectangle
    graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, 0, 0, image.Width - 1, image.Height - 1);
    // Draw inner rectangle
    graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, gap, gap, image.Width - gap - 1, image.Height - gap - 1);
    // Save the framed image
    image.Save(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "UseCases", "cat_with_honor_out.jpg"));
    // Your code for Step 5 goes here
}
```
