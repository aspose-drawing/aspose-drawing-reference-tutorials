## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.Drawing stands out as a powerful tool for graphics and image manipulation. To unlock the full potential of Aspose.Drawing, understanding licensing is paramount. This tutorial will guide you through various licensing methods, ensuring you seamlessly integrate Aspose.Drawing into your .NET projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into licensing with Aspose.Drawing, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Drawing Library: Download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/drawing/net/).
- License File: Acquire a valid license file from [Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
- .NET Environment: Ensure you have a working .NET development environment.

## Import Namespaces

Before we proceed, it's essential to import the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Loading License from a File

Let's start with the basics. Loading a license from a file is a common practice. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initialize License Object

```csharp
System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.License license = new System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.License();
```

### Step 2: Set License from File

```csharp
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Drawing.lic");
```

### Step 3: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
```

## Loading License from a Stream

Loading a license from a stream offers flexibility. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Initialize License Object

```csharp
System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.License license = new System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.License();
```

### Step 2: Load License from FileStream

```csharp
FileStream myStream = new FileStream("Aspose.Drawing.lic", FileMode.Open);
license.SetLicense(myStream);
```

### Step 3: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
```

## Using Metered License

Metered licensing provides a consumption-based model. Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Initialize Metered Object

```csharp
System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.Metered metered = new System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.Metered();
```

### Step 2: Set Metered Public and Private Keys

```csharp
metered.SetMeteredKey("your_public_key", "your_private_key");
```

### Step 3: Perform Processing

```csharp
// Your image processing logic here
```

### Step 4: Get Consumption Information

```csharp
decimal amount = System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
decimal credits = System.Drawing.AsposeDrawing.Metered.GetConsumptionCredit();
```

### Step 5: Display Information

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Amount Consumed: " + amount.ToString());
Console.WriteLine("Credits Consumed: " + credits.ToString());
```

## Conclusion

Mastering licensing in Aspose.Drawing is crucial for unleashing the full potential of this powerful .NET library. Whether loading from a file, stream, or using metered licensing, these steps ensure a seamless integration into your projects.
