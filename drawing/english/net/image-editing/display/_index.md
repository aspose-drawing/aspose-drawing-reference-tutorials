## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on displaying images using Aspose.Drawing for .NET! Aspose.Drawing is a powerful library that simplifies image manipulation in .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore the process of displaying images using the library, providing you with detailed steps and examples.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Drawing for .NET Library: Ensure you have the library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/drawing/net/).

- .NET Environment: Make sure you have a working .NET environment on your machine.

- Document Directory: Prepare a directory to store your images.

- Image File: Have an image file ready for display, e.g., "aspose_logo.png."

## Import Namespaces

To start, import the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
```

Now, let's break down the process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Create a Bitmap

Begin by creating a Bitmap object that will serve as the canvas for displaying the image.

```csharp
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
```

## Step 2: Initialize Graphics

Initialize a Graphics object from the created Bitmap. This object will allow you to draw on the bitmap.

```csharp
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);
```

## Step 3: Load the Image

Load the image you want to display. Adjust the file path accordingly.

```csharp
Bitmap image = new Bitmap("Your Document Directory" + @"Images\aspose_logo.png");
```

## Step 4: Draw the Image

Draw the loaded image onto the bitmap using the Graphics object.

```csharp
graphics.DrawImage(image, 0, 0);
```

## Step 5: Save the Result

Save the resulting image with the displayed image.

```csharp
bitmap.Save("Your Document Directory" + @"Images\Display_out.png");
```

Now, you've successfully displayed an image using Aspose.Drawing for .NET!
