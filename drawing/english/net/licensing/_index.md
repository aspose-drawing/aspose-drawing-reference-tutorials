## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use the same license file for multiple projects?**  
A: Yes. A single license file can be referenced by any number of applications on the same machine, as long as the license terms allow it.

**Q: What should I do if the license is not recognized at runtime?**  
A: Verify that the license file is copied to the output directory, that the file name matches exactly, and that the `License` class is instantiated before any Aspose.Drawing calls.

**Q: Does a trial license have usage limitations?**  
A: The trial mode adds a watermark to generated images and limits certain premium features. A full license removes these restrictions.

**Q: How can I programmatically check if the license was applied successfully?**  
A: After calling `new Aspose.Drawing.License().SetLicense("Aspose.Drawing.lic");`, you can catch any exceptions to confirm successful registration.

**Q: Is it safe to store the license file in source control?**  
A: For security reasons, avoid committing the license file to public repositories. Use environment‑specific deployment mechanisms instead.
