# Joining Paths with Pens in Aspose.Drawing

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.Drawing for .NET! In this tutorial, we'll delve into the art of joining paths with pens using Aspose.Drawing, a powerful library that provides extensive functionality for working with graphics and images in .NET applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the exciting world of path joining, make sure you have the following in place:

1. Aspose.Drawing Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.Drawing for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/drawing/net/).

2. .NET Development Environment: Have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

Now that we're all set, let's jump into the steps to join paths using pens in Aspose.Drawing.

## Import Namespaces

Before you begin coding, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
```

## Step 1: Create a Bitmap and Graphics Object

```csharp
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);
```

Here, we initialize a new `Bitmap` object with the specified dimensions and create a `Graphics` object from that bitmap.

## Step 2: Define the DrawPath Method

```csharp
private static void DrawPath(Graphics graphics, LineJoin join, int y)
{
    Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue), 30);
    GraphicsPath path = new GraphicsPath();
    path.StartFigure();
    path.AddLine(100, y, 200, y);
    path.AddLine(200, y, 200, y + 100);
    pen.LineJoin = join;
    graphics.DrawPath(pen, path);
}
```

In this step, we define a method called `DrawPath` that takes a `Graphics` object, a `LineJoin` enumeration, and a vertical position (`y`) as parameters. Inside the method, we create a `Pen` object with a specified color and width, a `GraphicsPath` object, and add lines to it.

## Step 3: Join Paths with Bevel LineJoin

```csharp
DrawPath(graphics, LineJoin.Bevel, 200);
```

Call the `DrawPath` method with `LineJoin.Bevel` to join paths with a bevel line join.

## Step 4: Join Paths with Round LineJoin

```csharp
DrawPath(graphics, LineJoin.Round, 400);
```

Now, call the `DrawPath` method with `LineJoin.Round` to join paths with a round line join.

## Step 5: Save the Result

```csharp
bitmap.Save("Your Document Directory" + @"Pens\Join_out.png");
```

Save the resulting image to your desired directory.

Now you've successfully created joined paths using pens in Aspose.Drawing! Experiment with different line join styles and incorporate them into your graphics.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the process of joining paths with pens in Aspose.Drawing for .NET. With just a few steps, you can enhance your graphics and create visually appealing designs.
